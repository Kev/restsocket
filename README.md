# restsocketdemo - librestpp and websocket demo

This piggybacks on the librestpp build system. Just check out into a librestpp checkout.

`git checkout https://github.com/Kev/librestpp.git && cd librestpp && https://github.com/Kev/restsocketdemo.git`

Then running `make` in the restsocket checkout will build the client and call back out to librestpp to build that.
